## Project Overview

The Seismic Tsunami Risk Prediction System represents a cutting-edge fusion of geophysical science and machine learning, designed to provide early tsunami warnings that could save thousands of lives. This system processes vast amounts of seismic data in real-time to predict tsunami risks with unprecedented accuracy.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Seismic Data Ingestion**: Real-time processing of global seismic events from monitoring networks
- **Feature Engineering**: 20+ engineered features using established physics models (Wells & Coppersmith)
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated data validation and anomaly detection

### Machine Learning Models
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combined 10+ algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85 with recall >0.90 for critical early warnings
- **Interpretability**: SHAP values for model explainability and scientific validation

### Visualization & Monitoring
- **3D Interactive Dashboard**: Global risk visualization using Plotly and GeoPandas
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live earthquake tracking and tsunami risk assessment
- **Geographic Analysis**: Spatial correlation analysis for risk zone identification

## Business Impact

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
The system incorporates a sophisticated cost-sensitive framework that balances the economic impact of false alarms (~$10K) against the potential catastrophic losses from missed warnings (~$1M+). This optimization ensures practical deployment viability.
